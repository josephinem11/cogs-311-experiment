var story_2 = `<p>Jake, who lives in California, is an avid hiker who likes to explore the outdoors. On one of his walks, he ran into his widow's sister Aimee who he had briefly met before in her Santa Monica home. The two hikers started chatting-it turned out they had a lot in common and enjoyed each other's company. After that day, they started spending a lot of time together and eventually decided they have feelings for each other and want to have a future together. When the time arrived for marriage to be discussed, moral and legal boundaries were put into question. The new law passed that residents of California cannot marry their spouse's siblings.</p>`
